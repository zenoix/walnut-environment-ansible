# Walnut Environment

This repository contains my Ansible setup to automate the installation and configuration of my development environment in Ubuntu and Arch distributions. 

This repo is heavily influenced and some parts were taken and modified from [TechDufus's dotfiles repo](https://github.com/TechDufus/dotfiles/tree/main).
